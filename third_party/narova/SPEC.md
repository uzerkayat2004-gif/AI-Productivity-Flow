# narova — public interface guide

<!-- narova-document-role: shipped-interface-guide; authority: non-normative -->

> **Role:** This is an informative guide to the interface shipped by the public

> One line: narova writes the words and the voice. A free local renderer draws the pictures.

## What it is

narova turns a scene script into a narrated mp4. The captions light up word
by word. Screen elements appear when the voice reaches them.

The work is split in three parts:

- **Python** (`tool/py/narova_tts`): speech and word timings. Nothing else.
- **Node** (`tool/src`): config validation, optional product
  walkthrough orchestration, the provider-neutral manifest, and composition.
- **Renderer provider** (`narova-renderer-provider/v1`): local HyperFrames for
  unrestricted browser visuals, or local no-browser Skia + FFmpeg when no browser
  is available.

The goal: an agent takes a user prompt, writes the scene script, and
`narova build` makes the video.

## Shipped invariants

- Caption timings must equal the real audio length. Python rescales them
  after loudnorm (see LEARNINGS #1).
- The generated page must be deterministic: one paused GSAP timeline, built
  synchronously. No looping CSS animations. No clocks, randomness, or network
  calls at render time.
- Scene clips must chain exactly: `start[i+1] = start[i] + dur[i]`, rounded to
  3 decimals. HyperFrames rejects overlap on the same track.
- XTTS runs on current `transformers` through the shim. Never downgrade.

## Layout

Narova ships as two independent artifacts: the executable CLI package in
`tool/`, and the agent-readable instructions in `skills/narova/`. Installing a
skill never places executable code on the machine; installing the CLI never
changes agent instructions.

```

The venv lives at `~/.narova/venv` (override with `$NAROVA_VENV`). It sits
outside the CLI package so a tool or skill update cannot delete it. The first
`synth` creates it.

## The pipeline

```
reel.config.mjs
   │  narova compile     out/manifest.json (versioned intermediate representation)
   ▼
   │  narova synth       Python: per-scene wavs + full.wav + timings.json
   ▼
   │  narova walkthrough capture   optional explicit browser take, timed to narration
   ▼
   │  narova compose     out/hf-*/ or out/no-browser-*/ selected provider project
   ▼
   │  narova build       synth + compose + selected local renderer
   ▼
out/video.mp4
```

synth caches every processed sentence (`~/.narova/cache/sentences/`, keyed by
backend + speaker + text + tempo) so a revision re-synthesizes only the
changed sentences — untouched scenes keep byte-identical audio. This is the
iteration-consistency behavior.

`out/`, `out/hf-*`, and `out/no-browser-*` are build folders. Every run regenerates them. The config
plus project `assets/` are source of truth. Walkthrough WebM, capture manifest,
and evidence frames are durable source assets, never build output.

## The scene script

```js

      ],
    },

      transition: "wipe",                 // optional: fade (default) | wipe | slide | zoom
      clip: "assets/bg.mp4",              // optional: b-roll video behind the scene
      // walkthrough: "onboarding",        // optional instead of clip
      vo: [ { who: "a", text: "This is narova." },
            { who: "b", text: "Scenes in, video out.", lang: "en" } ],  // lang: optional per-turn TTS language
      body: `<div class="s-title"><h1 class="reveal">narova</h1>
             <p class="cue" data-cue="1">scenes in, <span data-mark="underline">video out</span></p></div>` },
  ],
}
```

Rules:

- `vo` is the spoken dialogue, in order. One narrator = one `who`. Sentence
  segmentation recognizes English terminal punctuation plus Urdu full stop
  `۔` and question mark `؟`, so synthesis, timings, and caption groups stay
  aligned for Urdu and mixed-language turns.
- `provenance` records facts that artifacts cannot establish, such as script
  authorship. These values are always reported as declared, never verified;
  omitting the block is valid and reads "not declared".
- `body` is HTML, placed into the scene clip as-is.
- `data-cue="k"`: hidden until turn `k` starts. `k` counts from 0.
- `class="reveal"` (no cue): animates in when the scene starts.
- Timeline animators: `data-grow` (scaleX 0→1 from the left), `data-draw`
  (SVG stroke-dash self-draw), `data-count="N"` (+ optional
  `data-count-suffix`), `data-delay="s"` (added to the cue/entry trigger).
  `data-mark="underline|circle|box|highlight"` draws a hand-drawn-style
  annotation around the element at its cue time.
- Scene and voice ids must match `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]*`.
- Element ids in bodies are namespaced per scene at compose
  (`<sceneId>--<id>`; the body's own `url(#…)` / `href="#…"` / `for` /
  aria references are rewritten). Ids must be unique only within one scene,
  so reusable SVG `<defs>` can repeat across scenes. theme.css must not use
  `#id` selectors for body elements (`check` warns).
- Project `assets/` are source and are copied into generated `out/hf/assets/`.
  Inline SVG and data URIs are supported; remote render-time dependencies are
  rejected by the authoring workflow and warned by `narova check`.
- No `animation: ... infinite` in theme.css.
- `theme.mode` is `"dark"` (default) or `"light"` — a directive, not a color
  token; `"light"` swaps the built-in surface/ink/chrome-token defaults,
  which explicit tokens still override.
- `chrome` is `false` or an object with boolean `topbar` / `counter` /
  `progress` keys (all default true).
- Stats and superlatives in `vo` belong in the project's `claims.md` with a
  source; `check` warns when claim-looking lines have no ledger.
- `captions.preset` is `karaoke` (default), `slam`, `pop`, or `rise`;
  `captions.emphasis` words are matched case-insensitively,
  punctuation-stripped, and highlighted in every preset.
- `platform` picks the frame size when `size` is unset (`--size` beats the
  preset) and makes `check` warn when the estimated narration length falls
  outside the platform's target duration band.
- `bed` and `sfx` are mixed into the narration track by the synth stage
  (`references/audio.md`). SFX anchor to `scene` + scene-local `at`, or to
  the global timeline when `scene` is omitted. Files are resolved relative
  to the project. Music changes do not require re-synthesis.
- `align: true` replaces estimated word timings with measured ones
  (faster-whisper or whisper.cpp; `references/audio.md`). Off by default.
- `variants` are alternate scene-1 definitions for hook A/B tests;
  `narova build --variant <id>` / `--variants` render them.
- `walkthroughs` declare a driver-neutral URL, viewport, ready condition,
  authentication/containment options, cursor, and semantic action steps.
  Steps anchor to capture-relative seconds or measured scene/turn timing.
  A scene references one with `walkthrough: "id"` or
  `{id, layout, fit, opacity, position}` and cannot also use `clip`.
  Exploration/capture are explicit; compose/build only consume fresh,
  hash-verified assets. Base and hook-variant takes use separate paths, so
  every walkthrough-bearing variant is synthesized and captured explicitly
  before `build --variants`. Full public reference:
  `skills/narova/references/product-walkthroughs.md`.
- Old fields `caption` and `dur` are accepted and ignored.

Each scene must provide an HTML `body`, a portable `visual` tree, or both.
HyperFrames prefers `body` and compiles visual-only scenes to HTML. No-browser
requires `visual` and never parses or approximates HTML/CSS. This failure
boundary is intentional shipped behavior: changing renderer must not silently
lower a scene.
The portable node/motion contract and exact provider capability matrix live in
`skills/narova/references/renderers.md`.

`narova check` catches all of this. `narova check --strict` also verifies
that every detected claim actually appears in `claims.md`. `narova check
--release` adds a build gate: remote dependencies, unresolved assets, missing
claims, unsupported HTML, black frames, and stale walkthroughs fail the check.

## The generated page (`out/hf` interface)

`index.html` is a standard HyperFrames composition:

- Root `#root`: `data-composition-id="main"`, sized in px, `data-duration` = total.
- `#bg`: a full-size background child. Never put background on the root —
  the renderer can drop it (frame turns black).
- One `<section class="clip scene">` per scene, starts chained exactly; scene
  tracks contain at most three clips to keep Studio's timeline readable.
- A walkthrough scene adds a direct-root `<video>` clip with the scene's
  start/duration and a source trim offset into the continuous take. Window
  layout adds a generated browser shell; full layout is edge-to-edge. Captures
  never loop.
- One overlay clip on track 1000, full length: captions + progress bar.
- `<audio src="assets/narration.wav">` as a direct child of the root, track
  1001; HyperFrames infers its intrinsic duration.
- One inline `DATA` object + one paused GSAP timeline at `window.__timelines["main"]`.

`DATA` shape:

```
{ total,
  preset,                                        // caption style preset name
  scenes: [{ id, start, dur, turns[],            // turns are scene-local seconds
             transition? }],                     // fade|wipe|slide|zoom (absent = fade)
  groups: [{ who, label, start, end,             // one caption line per sentence
             words: [{ w, t0, t1, kw? }] }] }    // global seconds; kw=1 = emphasis word
```

Captions use `tl.set(el, {className}, t)` per word: upcoming → active → past.
This is safe when the renderer jumps to any time. Reveals and cues are
timeline tweens (opacity, y, scale); `data-grow`/`data-draw` are property
tweens (scaleX, stroke-dashoffset); `data-count` is stepped `tl.set` on
textContent. An animated SVG element carrying a `transform` attribute is
wrapped in a fresh `<g>` at load and the tween targets the wrapper, so the
attribute survives GSAP's CSS transform. The raw canvas and scene body fill the
frame without centering, gutters, max-width, or caption reserve. Top-level
`safeLayout: true` restores a centered `var(--colw, 1000px)` content column,
responsive gutters, and caption reserve.

Also in out/hf: the copied project `assets/`, `assets/narration.wav` (a copy
of `out/audio/mix.wav` when a bed/SFX mix was made, else
`out/audio/full.wav`), and `package.json` (pins the HyperFrames version).

## The Python runtime interface

In: `narration.json` + `config.resolved.json`.
Out: `audio/NN.wav`, `audio/NN.mp3`, `audio/full.wav`, `timings.json`, and
`audio/mix.wav` when `bed`/`sfx` is configured (full.wav + background bed + spot
SFX, same duration; narration is NOT re-loudnorm'd).

`timings.json`:

```
{ <sceneId>: { dur, turns: [sec...], words: [{ w, t0, t1, who, si }] } }
```

All times are scene-local seconds, already rescaled to the real audio.
`full.wav` length equals the sum of all `dur` (asserted, ~5ms per scene).
With `align` on, word `t0`/`t1` come from measured forced alignment instead of
length-weighted estimates (per-scene fallback to estimates on any mismatch).

## Revision ledger (advisory)

Every successful base build compares the effective resolved project state
(config + scene identities + narration/timing identities + renderer + render
context + output-affecting overrides) against the latest recorded revision
and appends one record to the append-only `out/revisions.jsonl` when — and
only when — that state changed. A rebuild of identical authored state records
no revision, even if encoded bytes differ. Variant and delivery members never
record revisions; standalone `synth`/`compose`/`captions` do not either.

Each record carries an ordinal, its parent ordinal, the audio/timing
fingerprints, manifest and render-context identities, per-scene identity
digests, measured per-stage durations, and a **measured reuse record** for
that build: which scenes' processed audio is byte-identical to the previous
revision (by content digest), which render spans were reused / re-rendered
by identity change / re-rendered by fallback, sentence-cache hit and fresh
counts, and the shared artifacts rebuilt by design (full mix, encoded video,
deliveries). Every ratio states its basis and unit; unevidenced quantities
are reported as not applicable, never invented. Fallback re-renders are
never counted as reuse.

The ledger is advisory evidence: losing or truncating it never fails any
operation (history simply restarts at v1), and a ledger write failure after a
successful build is reported without failing the build.

Commands find the config by walking up from the current directory, so they
work from inside `out/` and `out/hf`. A detached Studio preview left running
is restarted automatically whenever `compose`/`build` replaces `out/hf`.

Flags: `--backend <built-in-or-registered-provider>`,
`--renderer hyperframes|no-browser`, `--reuse` (ignored automatically when the
spoken text changed since the last synth), `--tempo`, `--size`,
`--platform tiktok|reels|shorts|linkedin|x|youtube` (frame preset + duration-band
lint; `--size` wins), `--variant <id>` / `--variants` (hook-variant builds;
each variant renders `out/video-<id>.mp4`), `--deliverables` (multi-render
with per-platform export presets + ffmpeg post-processing + thumbnails;
renders the SAME composition at each preset's aspect ratio via scale+pad —
this does NOT re-art-direct layouts; for truly platform-specific compositions,
render separate projects at each aspect ratio), `--fps`, `--quality draft|standard|high`, `--at` (shots), `--out`, `--project`,
`--config`, `--voice-a`, `--voice-b`.

## Backends

- **piper** — default. Fast, small, no setup. Downloads a voice on first use.
- **xtts** — higher quality, slow. ~1.9GB model, 58 speakers.
  Setup: `narova-setup --xtts`.
- **qwen** — Qwen3-TTS 0.6B, Apache 2.0. High quality, slow. ~1.2GB model,
  9 speakers, optional per-voice `lang`. Setup: `narova-setup --qwen`.
  Change the model with `$NAROVA_QWEN_MODEL`.
- **chatterbox** — voice cloning. Set the voice's `speaker` to an ABSOLUTE
  path to a clean 10–20s recording. Slowest backend. Runs in its own venv
  (`~/.narova/venv-chatterbox`, override `$NAROVA_CHATTERBOX_VENV`) because
  its torch/transformers pins conflict with xtts/qwen. ~1GB model, optional
  per-voice `exaggeration` / `cfg_weight`. Setup: `narova-setup --chatterbox`.
  Pinned to git master for Chatterbox Multilingual v3 (per-voice `lang`;
  outputs carry Resemble's PerTh watermark by default).

The backend interface is
`synthesize(who, text, out_path, lang=None) -> Path`.

Built-ins are resolved from one standalone-tool registry. Optional external backends
are never imported: the user explicitly registers a manifest under
`~/.narova/providers/`, then Narova spawns its command as an argument array
and speaks the versioned `narova-tts-provider/v1` JSON Lines protocol. External
workers produce one raw WAV utterance; Narova retains sentence caching, tempo,
gain, fades, resampling, loudness normalization, concatenation, alignment,
timing rescaling, captions, composition, and rendering. Provider-specific
code, credentials, dependencies, endpoints, models, and configuration rules
remain in self-contained companion skills such as `skills/narova-elevenlabs/`
and `skills/narova-openai/`.

The separately installed `skills/narova-3d-production/` companion adds no
runtime or provider. It supplies high-freedom technical judgment for authored
3D work and conditionally loads subjects/assets, scene-direction, or inspection
references. It distinguishes an accepted final representation from a blockout,
routes optional capabilities without bundling them, and isolates perceptual
review from author rationale. Core Narova's 3D authoring and rendering remain
complete when it is absent.

## Status: 0.31.14 shipped

Build works end to end. Lint and check pass on generated pages. Caption sync
verified in snapshots. The skill goes prompt → script → check → synth →
compose → preview → build by invoking the separately installed CLI. The tool
and its tests live in the independent top-level package.

Since 0.6.0: background bed + spot SFX mixing, forced word alignment (optional),
caption style presets + keyword emphasis, per-scene transitions, `data-mark`
annotations, `--platform` presets with duration-band lint, SRT/VTT caption
sidecars, hook-variant builds (`--variant`/`--variants`), `narova ingest <url>`,
Chatterbox v3 (git pin, per-voice `lang`).

Since 0.7.0: per-turn `lang` for multilingual TTS, voice sample management,
silent scenes, per-voice `gainDb`, b-roll as HyperFrames-native clips,
partial word alignment for mixed-language scenes, RTL captions, CSS
externalization, `captions.maxWords`, XTTS multilingual `lang` support,
version sync automation, platform qualification, and documentation remediation
across all surfaces.

Since 0.8.0: versioned manifest intermediate representation beneath the
friendly `reel.config.*` surface.

Since 0.8.1: comprehensive export profiles with per-platform render presets,
ffmpeg post-processing (loudness normalization, h264 encode, safe-area
guides, thumbnails), and `--deliverables` multi-render builds.

Since 0.13.0: narration-timed product walkthroughs with semantic
agent-browser actions, named exploration sessions, restore/profile support,
capture evidence and drift manifests, stale-capture gates, generated browser
framing, full-bleed composition, and a real browser-to-MP4 eval.

Since 0.17.0: two bundled free local renderer providers, a provider-neutral
`scene.visual` tree, browserless Skia/FFmpeg rendering, no-browser snapshots and
draft preview MP4s, local raster/SVG/font/RTL/video support, portable motion
and transitions, explicit capability rejection, and a complex no-browser eval.

Since 0.19.0: declarative 3D authoring via `scene.three` and `scene.elements`
(cameras, lights, primitives, models, GSAP-driven animations), Three.js upgraded
from r149 UMD to r185 ESM with GLTFLoader included, ACES filmic tone mapping
configurable (aces/agx/neutral/linear), built-in character presets (cat, mouse,
robot), InstancedMesh with geometry/material cache, `narova generate`
(Sora/Runway AI clip generation), project choreography hook
(`choreography: "choreo.js"`), PBR surface (roughness/metalness/maps),
shadows, environment maps, and camera animation helpers.

Since 0.20.0: creative modularity (6 scene file-reference types + `config.imports`),
expanded variant model with scene overrides and theme/captions/timing overrides,
neutral project scaffold, concept branching workflow, measured cue timing for 3D
animations (not `cue * 2` approximation), theme token preservation through
pipeline round-trips, deterministic seeded particle randomness (mulberry32),
`data-grow`/`data-mark` transformOrigin fix, GSAP vendored locally (zero CDN
dependencies), semantic action validation (unsupported actions fail clearly),
`--reuse` audio integrity check, release save/restore includes fingerprint for
reuse, creative-diversity eval suite (10 briefs), 470+ unit + 6 eval tests.

Since 0.26.0: neutral defaults (chrome off, monochrome palette, subtitle captions),
skill instruction de-anchoring (orthogonal creative dimensions replace archetype
menu, craft rules as optional critique), HF selective-render equivalence fixes
(transitions, choreography, markers, chrome, overlays), complete branch
snapshots (scene file refs + imports), bounded LRU cache retention,
deterministic timeline ontology (narration + markers + silence as co-equal
timing sources).

Since 0.28.0: both bundled renderers provide a genuinely full-frame raw path (no
implicit centering, max-width, gutter, or caption reserve), with `safeLayout`
as an independent opt-in; ambitious creation defaults to 2–3 small rationale-
backed proof branches and one selected expansion; creative briefs are medium-
neutral; `branch save` snapshots a candidate proof in one command; and
`shots --proof` rejects pilots whose sampled visual evidence is predominantly
near-black. Ambitious release validation requires 2–3 intact declared proof
branches and one approved selection. Its durable, project-bound branch proof bundle retains and validates byte-exact resolved
config, manifest, timings, audited frames, contact sheets, the originating
project identity, a stable proof identity, and hashes for every restorable
snapshot file. Declared branches must differ in both reviewed proof content and
restorable snapshot content, so aliases, edited sources, added sources, or
relabelled foreign evidence cannot satisfy divergence. The final brief records
the selected branch's exact stable proof identity as expansion lineage, and
restored snapshots automatically reapply proof-time CLI overrides. Snapshot and proof metadata publish under a per-branch lock and compare-and-swap as one staged pair, so a failed or concurrent
overwrite leaves the prior branch intact, while cleanup starts only after the
new pair commits.

## Timeline intermediate representation

`narova compile` converts `reel.config.*` → `out/manifest.json`, a versioned
JSON document that captures every datum the pipeline needs in one self-contained
file. The timeline is also written automatically during `synth` and `build`,
and enriched with measured word timings after synthesis.

**Versioning:** `narova` (tool version) and `version` (schema `"1.0"`) keys
enable forward-compatible consumers to gate on schema changes.

**Schema (top-level keys):** `narova`, `version`, `project`, `format`, `theme`,
`chrome`, `voices`, `timing`, `audio`, `captions`, `align`, `assets`,
`walkthroughs`, `scenes`,
`variants`, `series`, `variant`, `environment`, `hashes`, `deliverables`.

- `project` — title, creation timestamp, platform target.
- `renderer` — selected provider, protocol, and compile-time provider version
  when locally available (`null` otherwise).
- `format` — width, height, fps, sampleRate, colorSpace.
- `voices` — every voice with label, color, backend, speaker, gainDb, lang,
  instruct, exaggeration, cfg_weight.
- `walkthroughs` — portable semantic action plans, capture policy, viewport,
  timing anchors, and the content-addressed capture manifest.
- `scenes` — id, index, start/duration (filled post-synth), transition, vo
  turns (who, text, lang, start, words), body HTML, clip or walkthrough
  presentation, dur (silent scenes), per-scene sfx anchors.
- `variants` — hook variant ids with their full scene definitions (body, vo,
  transition).
- `assets` — all file dependencies discovered from `assetsDir/`, bed, sfx,
  b-roll clips, and captured walkthrough media/evidence.
- `deliverables` — render presets: at least a `default` entry plus one per
  platform when `platform` is set. Entries carry width, height, fps, codec,
  bitrate, sampleRate.
- `stages.synth` — ISO timestamp set after synthesis completes.
- `environment` — narova version, TTS backend, compile-time backend version
  when locally available (`null` otherwise), renderer, and compile timestamp.
- `hashes` — SHA-256 content hashes for config, theme CSS, assets/ tree,
  bed/sfx/clip source files, and walkthrough capture inputs/media.

**Consumers:** `validate(manifest)` checks schema compliance; `mergeTimings()`
merges `out/timings.json` word-level data into the scene tree; and `narova plan`
compares manifests to classify changes.
