const README = `# My Project

A narova project. For an ambitious brief, keep the config to a small proof,
save 2–3 directions with rationale, approve one, and only then expand it:

\`\`\`bash
narova check      # validate the config (fast)
narova critique creative  # challenge intent, proof evidence, and rejection criteria
narova synth      # create narration + timings
narova compose && narova shots --motion --proof  # inspect + reject an invisible pilot
narova branch save proof-a --rationale "why this direction may serve the brief"
# repeat for proof-b/proof-c; then: narova branch set proof-b --status approved
narova preview --detach  # persistent Studio; prints the review URL
narova build --reuse --release  # after approval -> out/video.mp4
\`\`\`

The first build sets up its own Python venv (~/.narova/venv) and downloads a
voice model. One-time wait, not a hang. \`narova doctor\` checks the machine.
`;

const CREATIVE_BRIEF = `# Creative brief

Status: draft
Ambition: routine | ambitious

Set Status to \`approved\` only after the selected proof meets this intent.

## Creative intent

- Audience, purpose, and viewing context:
- What should become newly felt, understood, or possible:
- Unusual hypothesis worth proving:
- Source/reference evidence that must survive:
- Hard constraints and deliberate exclusions:

## Directions considered

For an ambitious brief, describe 2–3 meaningfully different hypotheses. Vary
representation, temporal logic, spatial logic, sound relationship, or audience
interaction—not merely palette. Each direction should become only a small proof.

## Proof branches

| Branch | Rationale | Smallest decisive proof | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| proof-a | | | exploring |
| proof-b | | | exploring |

Selected proof branch:
Why it won against the rejection criteria:
Expanded from proof branch:
Expanded proof identity:

Do not build three complete videos. Compose only enough material to settle the
risky creative question, then use \`narova branch save <name> --rationale "..."\`.

## Medium and behavior

- Chosen medium/material and why it carries the idea:
- Representation logic (literal, symbolic, procedural, evidentiary, hybrid):
- Temporal logic (continuous, accumulative, fragmented, cyclical, responsive):
- Spatial or compositional logic:
- Role of speech, sound, silence, and text:
- Signature behavior or transformation unique to this work:
- Optional medium-specific controls, only when relevant (camera, depth,
  lighting, interaction, typography, physical performance, simulation, etc.):

## Beat map

For every narration sentence or named marker, state what materially changes and
why that change advances the intent. Camera, depth, and light are conditional;
leave them out when the chosen medium does not use them.

## Pilot gate

- [ ] 2–3 small proof branches were saved with distinct rationale (ambitious work).
- [ ] Each proof isolates a decisive creative risk instead of pretending to be a full film.
- [ ] The selected proof demonstrates the intended representation and temporal behavior.
- [ ] A relevant edge state, transition, detail, or interaction was inspected.
- [ ] Rendered proof frames were compared with references and this written intent.
- [ ] One branch was selected; weaker directions were rejected before expansion.

## Rejection criteria

<!-- Replace this comment with observable, medium-specific reasons a proof must
be rebuilt. Possible dimensions include: familiar-template convergence, an
invisible decisive change, lost evidence, contradictory rhythm, ambiguous
interaction, generic craft, or missing reference-specific qualities. -->
