# Public implementation-maintainer notes

<!-- narova-document-role: implementation-maintainer-notes; authority: non-normative -->

These are concrete implementation failures and maintenance constraints from the
public Narova codebase. Keep the fixes in the code so they do not return.

This file is non-normative: it is not the product specification, roadmap,
research store, strategic memory, or agent context ledger. Product requirements
and future decisions are governed outside this public implementation repository.
Another implementation should keep notes for its own technology instead of
copying these mechanics as product requirements.

## Audio / timing

1. **`loudnorm` shortens audio (~2.9% per scene) → captions drift.**
   We computed word times from the audio pieces BEFORE loudnorm. The final
   audio was shorter, so captions fell more and more behind the voice.
   **Fix (mandatory):** after making each scene's final wav, measure its real
   length and multiply all word/turn times by `real / computed`. loudnorm
   shrinks the whole scene evenly, so one factor is exact. See
   `rescale_timings()`. Verify: sum of scene durations == length of the
   joined audio, within a few ms.

2. **Word timing is computed, not measured (by default).** We synthesize each sentence
    alone (so we know its length) and spread the words across it, weighted by
    word length. Good enough for karaoke captions. When `align: true`, word
    timings come from measured forced alignment (faster-whisper or whisper.cpp);
    otherwise, length-weighted estimates are used.

3. **Control the pauses yourself.** Neural TTS pauses randomly on
   punctuation. We synthesize sentence by sentence and insert fixed silence:
   sentence gap ~0.24–0.30s, speaker change ~0.44–0.52s, lead ~0.16s,
   tail ~0.6s. This makes pacing even.

4. **Add tiny fades (~12ms) at every splice point** or you hear clicks.

5. **Loudness: use `loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11`.** Raw XTTS peaks near
   0 dBFS (clips), and the two voices differ in loudness. loudnorm fixes
   both — but it changes duration, so the rescale in #1 is required.

## XTTS-v2 (coqui-tts) on a modern stack — use the NEW libs, do not downgrade

6. **`transformers` 5.x removed `isin_mps_friendly`**, which coqui-tts
   imports. Do NOT pin transformers old. Shim it (~5 lines) in
   `xtts_compat.py`, imported BEFORE `from TTS.api import TTS`. Edge case:
   `test_elements` can be a 0-dim tensor — `unsqueeze` it, or MPS throws
   `IndexError: tuple index out of range`.

7. **torch ≥2.9 needs `torchcodec`** for audio IO (`pip install torchcodec`).

8. **`COQUI_TOS_AGREED=1`** must be set or the model will not load.

9. **The XTTS `speed` option is broken** (1.12 made audio LONGER). Never use
   it. Speed up with ffmpeg `atempo` instead, and compute duration as
   `probe(raw) / tempo`.

10. **XTTS runs on Apple MPS** once shimmed (~17s load, 2–7s per sentence).
    Model download is ~1.87GB, one time. 58 built-in speakers; pick two
    different ones for the duet.

## Rendering — HISTORICAL (replaced by HyperFrames in 0.3.0)

> Items #11–#17 describe the old homemade renderer (own player + Chrome
> screenshots + ffmpeg + a serve command). 0.3.0 deleted it; HyperFrames owns
> preview and render now. The items stay because they explain WHY the rescale
> in #1 exists. New rendering learnings:
> (a) a comment before `<!doctype html>` makes hyperframes lint reject the
>     file as a fragment;
> (b) a background on the composition ROOT can render black — put it on a
>     full-size child;
> (c) scene clip starts must be a running sum of already-rounded durations,
>     or the overlap lint fires;
> (d) CSS `animation: ... infinite` and transitions break under seek-based
>     rendering — all motion goes on the paused GSAP timeline.

11. *(historical)* Homebrew ffmpeg often lacks libass, so subtitle filters
    are unavailable. We rendered the mp4 from the HTML player itself: a
    deterministic "still at time T" mode plus headless-Chrome screenshots.
12. *(historical)* Capture one frame per word start, not fixed fps. The
    screen only changes at word starts. ~800 frames instead of ~11,000.
13. *(historical)* Headless Chrome can hang after writing the screenshot.
    Fix: 45s timeout + own process group + re-shoot empty frames.
14. *(historical)* ffmpeg `-shortest` cuts the mp4 if frame total ≠ audio
    total. After the #1 rescale they match; assert it.
15. *(historical)* Still mode set `html[data-still]` so animations settle
    instantly while un-fired cues stay hidden.
16. *(historical)* Build scene DOM with `appendChild` (not
    `insertBefore(firstChild)`, which reverses order).
17. *(historical)* Python's `http.server` has no Range support, so video
    seeking breaks. We shipped a 206-capable server. Gone in 0.3.0.

## Small stuff

18. Subprocess stdout is block-buffered when piped to a file. Progress lines
    appear late. Use `flush=True`.
19. `ffprobe -of default=np=0:nk=1` (short form) fails on some builds. Use
    the long form: `default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1`.
20. The ffmpeg `subtitles=` filter cannot parse some absolute paths. Run with
    `cwd` set and a relative filename.
21. macOS `say --data-format` conflicts with `.aiff` output — omit it.
22. **espeak-ng (inside piper) breaks on long install paths** (~160-char
    internal buffer). A venv deep in a temp folder fails with
    `Error processing file '.../phontab'`; the same install at a short path
    works. The default `~/.narova/venv` is short on purpose.
23. **A detached Studio preview serves stale output after `compose`.** Studio
    holds `out/hf` open; compose deletes and recreates that directory, so the
    preview shows the old build or an empty `00:00 / 00:00` canvas — and a
    browser refresh does NOT recover it. Fix: `preview --detach` restarts a
    running server on the new build (port remembered in `preview.port`), and
    `compose`/`build` warn when a preview is live. Snapshots are the
    verification tool; Studio is for watching.
24. **Light themes need tokenized chrome, not `#bg` overrides.** The base
    stylesheet hardcoded dark values (`#0c1526` chips, `#5f6f8e` caption idle
    words, teal `rgba(46,230,214,…)` glows) outside the theme tokens, so a
    light-brand site meant `!important` on `#bg` plus a cascade of contrast
    failures. Fix: every surface value is a token (`deep, halo, chip,
    capidle, onaccent, track`) and `theme.mode: "light"` swaps the set.
25. **Box-based overlap lint misses oversized display type.** A big `vw`
    font with `line-height` < 1 paints outside its element box; lint compares
    boxes, not glyphs, so a giant stat can overlap the eyebrow above it and
    pass. Verify display type with snapshot frames; keep `line-height >= 1`.
26. **Grounding needs a gate, not prose.** "Match the source" guidance alone
    did not stop fabricated stats (an invented hook number, an inflated
    "leading"/"2,000+"). Fix: a `claims.md` ledger (verbatim / paraphrase /
    inference + source) is required before synth, and `check` sniffs `vo`
    for stats/superlatives with no ledger present.

## Usability fixes (0.6.0, from a real customer session)

27. **GSAP tweens destroy SVG `transform` attributes.** A `.reveal`/`.cue` on
    `<g transform="translate(x,y)">` renders the group at the origin — GSAP's
    CSS transform replaces the presentation attribute. Fix: at load, the
    runtime wraps any animated SVG element carrying `transform` in a fresh
    `<g>`, moves the animation classes/attrs to the wrapper, and tweens that
    (`shieldSvgTransform` in compose/runtime.js).
28. **Entrance-only motion limited infographics.** There was no way to grow a
    bar, draw a path, or count a number. Fix: timeline animators `data-grow`
    (scaleX tween), `data-draw` (stroke-dashoffset tween), `data-count`
    (stepped `tl.set` on textContent — a callback-driven tween is NOT used
    because seeks suppress events), plus `data-delay` to control stagger.
    All seek-safe; CSS animation stays banned.
29. **Page-wide id uniqueness blocked reusable SVG.** Gradient `<defs>` ids
    collided across scenes on the single page, forcing flat fills. Fix:
    compose namespaces every body id to `<sceneId>--<id>` and rewrites the
    body's own `url(#…)` / `href="#…"` / `for` / aria references
    (compose/html.js `namespaceIds`). Ids must be unique only within a scene;
    theme.css `#id` selectors silently stop matching, so `check` warns on them.
30. **Fixed chrome + no auto-fit = manual collisions (pre-0.28 safe layout).** Tall scenes slid under
    the topbar/caption band while box-lint reported 0 issues. Fix: the canvas
    reserves the caption band height (`padding-bottom:clamp(84px,15vh,170px)`)
    and the column width is a token (`--colw`, default 1000px). There is still
    no auto-fit — cap tall visuals by hand and trust `narova shots` frames,
    not lint. Contrast lint also false-positives on decorative glyphs.
31. **`--reuse` correctness was author-tracked.** Stale audio shipped if you
    reused after editing `vo`. Fix: `resolveReuse()` compares the new
    narration against the `narration.json` the last synth consumed and
    silently upgrades to a full synth on any difference.
32. **cwd broke commands.** Running narova from `out/hf` (after a hyperframes
    `cd`) failed with "No config found". Fix: `findConfig` walks up to the
    nearest ancestor holding a `reel.config.*`.
33. **Stale detached previews needed manual restarts.** Studio serves the
    deleted `out/hf` (LEARNINGS #23). Fix: `compose`/`build` now restart a
    live detached preview on the new build automatically (same port); the
    warning is only a fallback if the restart fails.
34. **Duration was emergent, not targetable.** Length was unknown until audio
    existed. Fix: `narova check` prints an estimated narration length
    (~170 wpm × tempo + fixed gaps, calibrated against real piper builds)
    so word count/tempo can be tuned to a target duration before synth.
35. **The piper starter list read as "3 voices".** Any piper catalog voice
    works via `voices get`; the list now shows a spread of 9 (gender/accent)
    so multi-host casts don't reach for the heavy backends by default.
## Motion on the timeline (0.7.0)

37. **A `fromTo` caption tween parks upcoming words at the from-state.** The
    slam preset's `tl.fromTo(word, {scale: 1.7}, …, w.t0)` rendered EVERY
    not-yet-spoken word at scale 1.7 until its turn — the caption line piled
    onto itself (caught only by looking at rendered frames; lint is blind to
    it). Before a tween's start, GSAP renders progress 0 = the from-values.
    Fix: build word motion from `.to()` tweens only, so the pre-start state
    stays the natural scale 1. Same trap as #27/#28: on a seeked timeline,
    every tween's off-window state is part of the design, not an afterthought.
    (`pop` is exempt on purpose: small/dim IS the designed resting state.)

## 3D, choreography, and variants (0.19 — 0.20)

- **Three.js r185 ESM requires a global script bundle.** The r149 UMD was
  deprecated and removed. esbuild-bundled global script with GLTFLoader included
  is the only path that survives HyperFrames' compiler tree-shaking. Dynamic
  ESM imports get stripped to stubs.
- **GLTF models must be prefetched and parsed before frame 0.** Async XHR
  mid-scene pop-in breaks deterministic rendering. `fetch` + `parseAsync` +
  `Promise.all(_pending)` gating ensures the assembled scene is ready at frame 0.
- **Material opacity on Groups requires traversal.** `object.material` on a
  `THREE.Group` is undefined — the old code silently killed the scene. Walk
  descendants and drive every material's opacity from the GSAP timeline.
- **Material-cache opacity bleed** — meshes that animate opacity need isolated
  materials. Sharing the cache makes tweening one mesh fade all same-colored
  siblings.
- **`transformOrigin` in GSAP tweens breaks HyperFrames' sub-composition timeline**
  under hyperframes@0.7.64. Pre-seed via `tl.set()` before the tween; never
  include it in `fromTo`/`to` properties.
- **Theme tokens must survive round-trips.** The manifest previously only stored
  accent and bg. Custom tokens (stage, deep, halo, colw, user-defined) were
  silently lost in configFromManifest. Every validated token must be spread
  into the manifest and reconstructed downstream.
- **`{ at: { cue: N } }` must use measured turn timings.** The pre-0.20 `cue * 2`
  approximation made 3D animations fire at arbitrary 2-second boundaries.
  `animationTweens` now accepts a measured `turns[]` array and resolves to actual
  start times from timings.json.
- **Particles need seeded randomness.** Unseeded `Math.random()` made every build
  produce different particle layouts. mulberry32 PRNG seeded from scene+object
  identity gives identical output for identical input, and different output for
  different explicit seeds.
- **Unsupported actions must fail validation, not silently compile.** `draw`,
  `speak`, `react`, `follow`, `transform` were in ACTION_TYPES but `actionToAnim()`
  returned null for all of them — validation accepted them but they had zero effect.
- **GSAP must be vendored, not CDN-loaded.** Three.js was already vendored;
  GSAP was the last runtime CDN dependency. Vendored 3.14.2 in `vendor/gsap/`.
- **Release restore needs fingerprint for `--reuse`.** Without it, every restore
  forces a full synth (even though the sentence cache would serve identical audio).
  Saving `.audio-fingerprint`, `.timings-fingerprint`, and `timings.json` in
  releases preserves safe reuse and measured-duration provenance.
- **Variant model must support more than hook copy.** The original `{ scene: { body, vo } }`
  was scene-1 only. `sceneOverrides`, `theme`/`captions`/`timing` overrides, and
  kind tags (visual/narration/pacing/captions) expand the model without making
  variants opaque full-project forks.
- **Release gates must run before render writes.** `build --release` preflights
  the base plus selected/all variants before production begins. Because speech
  duration is unknown until synthesis, retain a scene-topology-aware timing
  fingerprint and recheck measured duration before compose/render.
- **Proof identity must bind the complete restorable input.** Hashing only a
  config misses mutable assets and added files. Rehash source assets when a proof
  is saved, bind the complete snapshot, and require an exact file inventory.
- **Raw layout must not hide composition policy.** A raw frame must not silently
  center, constrain, gutter, or reserve caption space; layout assistance remains
  an explicit opt-in.

## Render-path CSS compatibility (0.8.3)

38. **CSS blur, drop-shadow, mix-blend-mode, and backdrop-filter force
    HyperFrames into screenshot capture for every frame.** On a 2-minute
    30fps video that turns a ~3-minute render into 8+ minutes. The fast
    drawElement capture path cannot handle these properties. Before synth,
    `narova check` warns on all of them in theme.css and scene bodies.
    Replace blur with opacity layers, drop-shadow with plain strokes,
    brightness/contrast/saturate filters with opacity, and mix-blend-mode
    with a flat rgba background. Wipe transitions also use clip-path and
    trigger the same slow path — swap to fade for long videos (>30s).
    B-roll clips shorter than their scenes must be pre-looped with ffmpeg
    (`narova compose` now does this automatically).
